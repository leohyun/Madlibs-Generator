## What is MadlibsJS? ##
MadlibsJS is based on a game called Madlibs. Unlike previous versions of this game, with MadlibsJS, you are first given a random story. You will have textboxes to submit any answer! In MadlibsJS, there is no limit to whatever parts-of-speech you can use. However, the catch is that in each textbox you'll only have a number of characters you can type into the textbox. Be funny, be romantic, be whatever! Have fun and be creative!

## Why did you make this game? ## 
MadlibsJS was a good project to incorporate varies concepts from strings, arrays, and HTML/CSS design to develop the game. This game is intended for kids and adults to have fun with reading and writing. MadlibsJS can help players discover new words given a limited number of characters to fit into the context of a story. In doing so, the general idea to to help people expand their vocabulary. 

## What did you change? ## 
At first, the project was on the Madlibs track, but took a pivot to work on another game called "Cards Against Humanity." However, due to time constraints and the difficulty to implement some features, the idea reverted back on the Madlibs track.
