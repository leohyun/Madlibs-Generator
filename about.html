        <ol class="aboutp"> Mad Libs, created in 1953, is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the often comical or nonsensical story aloud. The blanks are usually substituted by words with different parts of speech. For example, there can be verbs, adjectives, or any other parts of speech  replace the blanks. </ol>
        <ol class="aboutp"> Our version of Mad Libs is a new and improved one in which you are not required to enter a part of speech, but rather have text limits. There is a print button at the end of page so that you can brag about it to your friends and family when you are done! Now then, check out more on the history or start playing! </ol>
